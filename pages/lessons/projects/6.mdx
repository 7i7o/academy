<LessonHeader
  title="Create your own Tokens using Foundry"
/>

## What are we creating?

At the end of this lesson you will be able to create your own ERC20 tokens, and
you will be able to change its properties in any way you need.

## Tokens, Crypto, Coins, ERC20, is it all the same?

Let's begin with some context, so we all speak the same language.

The Ethereum blockchain (and most EVM-compatible blockchains) has a native token
that is used to pay for transaction costs, and also to reward validators in
Proof of Stake, or previously miners in Proof of Work. In Ethereum that native
token is Ether (or ETH), in Polygon its MATIC, and so on.

Let's focus on the Ethereum blockchain for the sake of clarity.

Every _other_ Token or "Crypto" you see, use or interact with in Ethereum is
basically a smart contract that lets you send these tokens, receive them and
check your balance.

Stablecoins like **DAI**, Tether (**USDT**), USD Coin (**USDC**) or tokens from
projects like Uniswap (**UNI**), MakerDAO (**MKR**), Basic Attention Token
(**BAT**) are all smart contracts that follow a standard, the ERC20 standard.

## Why do we want to create yet another Token?

A lot of reasons, but here are some:

- We are learning and we want to know how the ecosystem works
- We have a project or DAO that needs some means of governance
- We have a community that wants to be a part, take some ownership or support
  our project
- We need a token with extra functionality that doesn't exist yet

The possibilities are endless.

## What do we need to do with our Tokens?

Some basic functionality that our tokens need to provide are:

- Transfer tokens from one account to another
- Get the current token balance for an account
- Get the total supply of tokens available in the network
- Approve an amount of tokens from an account to be spent by a third-party
  account

<SideDrawer buttonText="More info on the ERC20 Standard">

To achive the functionality needed for an ERC20 token, the standard requires us
to implement 9 methods and 2 events.

Here is a quick overview of what our contracts needs to be called an ERC20 Token
contract:

```solidity
// Methods:
function name() public view returns (string)
function symbol() public view returns (string)
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)

// Events:
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

You can check the details in the full EIP-20 titled
[ERC-20: Token Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20#token)

</SideDrawer>

## Has someone created a battle-tested library for the standard?

Yes. OpenZeppelin (among others) has created an implementation we can inherit to
create
our own tokens easily.

## Let's code, but first...

Before we start hacking away without any structure to follow, what is our
project's structure and what do we want to achieve?

Since we are _BUIDLING_, i'd like to think of our project, or smart contract,
the same way as we would _roughly_ build a house:

    * 1 - Foundations
    * 2 - Structure: Framing, Walls and Roof
    * 3 - Doors and Windows
    * 4 - Security
    * 5 - Final touches

Before we build, we need a stable, leveled surface to place our foundations so
we can build on top.

The tools for coding and the project's file/folder structure will be our
foundations.

## Setting up Foundations

Before coding our basic contract, we need to create a project and set up our IDE
to code. Let's go into the folder where we store all our Academy projects:

```bash
## (OPTIONAL) create a folder for our D_D Academy projects
mkdir d_d_academy
cd d_d_academy
```

You can use whatever tools you feel confident or accostumed to.
For this example we will be creating a Foundry project, but feel free to use
Hardhat or Truffle if that's your favourite flavor.
The main focus of Foundry is that you don't need to use Javascript at all if you
don't want to.
All the tools are CLI commands. For tests and scripts, you only need Solidity!

![foundry-banner.png](/assets/lessons/6/foundry-banner.png)

These instructions are for Linux and MacOS. If you use Windows, we **strongly**
recommend using
WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), or else you will need to build the tools from
source. Using WSL
is an investment in the long term anyway, since most development and Open Source
work is done inside Unix environments. We encourage you to try it.
There is also a Docker container if you prefer it. All options are detailed in
the [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

To download foundry, we need to run this command on the console:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

This will download and install the `foundryup` tool. It will also update your
the $PATH environment variable inside your shell's config file. Please read the
output from this command to see if it detected your shell properly (Bash, zsh,
fish...) and follow the instructions to refresh your environment, or just close
the terminal and open a new one to be sure the environment has been updated.

Now let's run this tool to install the Foundry toolkit:

```bash
foundryup
```

If everything goes well, you will have four tools to run in the console:
`forge`, `cast`, `anvil` & `chisel`.
Basic overview of each tool:

- `forge` tests, builds and deploys your smart contracts
- `cast` an make smart contract calls, send transactions, or retrieve any type
  of chain data
- `anvil` is a local testnet node shipped with Foundry. You can use it for
  testing your contracts from frontends or for interacting over RPC
- `chisel` provides an interactive environment for writing and executing
  Solidity code, as well as a set of built-in commands for working with and
  debugging your code, which makes it a useful tool for quickly testing and
  experimenting with Solidity code without having to spin up a full foundry
  project

Now we can create our project with:

```bash
forge init my_token
```

Let's see what our project looks like:

```bash
cd my_token
tree . -d -L 1
```

This command outputs something like this:

```bash
.
├── lib
├── script
├── src
└── test

4 directories
```

The folders in our project are used like this:

- `lib` _dependencies_: Forge uses git submodules instead of Node
  Packages. This means it works with any GitHub repository that contains smart
  contracts.
- `script` scripts: automate transactions or deployment or our smart contracts
  (scripts are written in solidity!)
- `src` source: where our smart contract code will live
- `test` tests: write tests for our smart contracts (also in solidity!)

The default project includes a basic smart contract. We can build it to
see how forge commands work:

```bash
forge build
```

My output:

```bash
[⠊] Compiling...
[⠑] Installing solc version 0.8.19
[⠊] Successfully installed solc 0.8.19
[⠒] Compiling 20 files with 0.8.19
[⠑] Solc 0.8.19 finished in 6.08s
Compiler run successful
```

And now we can test it:

```bash
forge test
```

My output:

```bash
[⠰] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped

Running 2 tests for test/Counter.t.sol:CounterTest
[PASS] testIncrement() (gas: 28334)
[PASS] testSetNumber(uint256) (runs: 256, μ: 27553, ~: 28409)
Test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; finished in 19.11ms
```

As we mentioned earlier, we are going to use OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation.
To use it, we need to install OpenZeppelin as a dependency in our project. To
install dependencies in Foundry, we can use:

```bash
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
```

This looks for the repo called `openzeppelin-contracts` from the GitHub user
`OpenZeppelin` and downloads it as a git submodule.

This is the output I got:

```bash
Installing openzeppelin-contracts in "/home/myuser/d_d_academy/my_token/lib/openzeppelin-contracts" (url: Some("https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts"), tag: None)
    Installed openzeppelin-contracts v4.8.0
```

We can now import OpenZeppelin contracts in our smart contracts, but we can go
the extra-mile to use the same import line we used in Hardhat before.
We need to create a `remappings.txt` file in the root of our project:

```bash
forge remappings > remappings.txt
echo "@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/" >> remappings.txt
```

This tells Forge, “Hey, anytime you hit `@openzepplin/`, look in
`lib/openzeppelin-contracts/` instead.”

Now that we have an overview of the tools and the OpenZeppelin's libraries
installed, we can clean up the files we won't use and start fresh:

```bash
rm script/*
rm src/*
rm test/*
```

Now that we have everything ready, we can go ahead and start coding Solidity.

## Create the Framing and Walls

We need our house to have a structure and a floor plan with walls dividing the
rooms. Let's think of that setting as the 9 methods and 2 events that we saw
earlier for our code to be ERC20 compliant.

It's a great exercise to try and implement them from scratch, and we ecourage
you to do that once you start diving deeper into Solidity. It is also a great
challenge to do it and later compare your code to a battle-tested code like
OpenZeppelin's implenetation.

In this lesson we'll start by inheriting OZ's and then choosing the specifics
our token needs.

Let's start by creating a `MyToken.sol` file inside the `src/` folder with the
basics:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.19;

contract MyToken {
}
```

Once we have that, we can import and inherit OpenZeppelin ERC20:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.19;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
}
```

Now that we have the full implementation inherited, we still have to specify a
few more things before compiling, because the ERC20 constructor **needs** to
receive 2 parameters, the token's name and symbol, or it will raise an error.
In order to do that, we will define our constructor and call our inherited
contract's constructor:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.19;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {}
}
```

With those few lines, we inherit all the functions and events we needed.

One final consideration is adding a Roof above ourselves, to be able to live in
and finish the structure around us. What good is a house with no roof?

We have all the rooms and functions we needed, but no tokens exist yet. What
good is a token with no supply?
We can think of the initial allocation of tokens as the way to put a roof on the
house and finish the structure. If you choose not to have an initial allocation,
that's also valid and can skip this, but for our example we'll allocate an
arbitrary amount of tokens to the deployer of the contract on our constructor:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.19;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    constructor(uint256 initialAllocation) ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {
        _mint(msg.sender, initialAllocation);
    }
}
```

The internal function `_mint` takes care of creating the tokens and assigning
them to the `msg.sender`'s balance.

## Opening Doors to our house

We now have a full structure, with a roof to shelter us from the weather. The
only problem is that we didn't create any openings for anyone to enter
or leave the house.

We can think of entering the house as `minting` new tokens or increasing the
total supply, and leaving the house as `burning` tokens or decreasing the total
supply. But this doors doesn't exist in our contract just yet.

<Callout emoji='💡' size='md' variant='info'>

If you are planning on leaving a fixed total supply like the `initialSupply` we
used recently, that's also a valid approach and you don't need to create a
`mint` or `burn` function.

</Callout>

We need to create public facing functions to achieve this:

```solidity

// ... pragma + import lines

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    // ... constructor lines

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }

    function burn(uint256 amount) public {
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    // In case we have allowance from other address to transfer/burn their tokens:
    function burnFrom(address from, uint256 amount) public {
        _burn(from, amount);
    }
}
```

When we define our `mint` function, we decide who will be the receiver of said
new tokens.

For the `burn` function on the other hand, we are **only** letting holders burn
their own tokens by using `msg.sender` as the address to call the internal
`_burn` function.

In the special case someone approved us to operate on an amount of their tokens,
we created a `burnFrom` function to be able to burn within our approved
allowance from other address. If we try to burn (or transfer) more than our
approved allowance, the ERC20 implementation from OZ will revert our
transaction because that's required by the ERC20 standard.

We have now created doors to our house, but we haven't put locks in them!

## Lock the Door!

In our present state, our functions for minting and burning can be called by any
address.

That's ok for `burn` since people can only burn their own tokens (or their
approved allowances), but we don't want anyone to `mint` tokens and increase the
total supply of our new token.

To be able to limit the access to minting tokens, we are going to use a pattern
that OpenZeppelin calls AccessControl to give granular access to functionality
within our code. For that we will inherit yet another great contract from the OZ
library.

We can basically define **roles** and assign or un-assign them to any address we
need.

In our case, we will only create a `MINTER_ROLE` to allow access to our
`mint` function:

```solidity

// ... pragma + import lines

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20, AccessControl {

    bytes32 public constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");

    constructor(uint256 initialAllocation) ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {
        // Allow msg.sender to grant roles
        _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);

        // Grant MINTER_ROLE to msg.sender
        _grantRole(MINTER_ROLE, msg.sender);

        _mint(msg.sender, initialAllocation);
    }

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }

    // ... burn functions

}
```

Let's break down our changes in the code:

- Added and `import` before our contract definition
- Inherited the `AccessControl` in our contract definition
- Created a `bytes32 public constant` variable for the minter role
- Inside our `constructor`:
  - Granted the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to contract deployer to be able to grant
    roles to others
  - Granted the `MINTER_ROLE` to contract deployer to be able to mint tokens
- Added the modifier `onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE)` to the `mint` function to restrict
  its access

So, we basically imported `AccessControl` and inherited it to gain all its
functionality, we gave minter and 'admin' roles to the address that will deploy
the contract and then restricted access to our `mint` function.

Now any address that doesn't have the `MINTER_ROLE` granted, will revert on any
transaction that calls our `mint` function. Hooray! Our door is now
locked (only) for intruders!

## Final Touches and details

Congratulations! We have built a fully functioning token!

<SideDrawer buttonText="Here's my final Solidity code">

Here we have our fully functioning house, I mean... token:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.19;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20, AccessControl {

    bytes32 public constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");

    constructor(uint256 initialAllocation) ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {
        _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _grantRole(MINTER_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _mint(msg.sender, initialAllocation);
    }

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }

    function burn(uint256 amount) public {
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function burnFrom(address from, uint256 amount) public {
        _burn(from, amount);
    }
}
```

</SideDrawer>

Given that we have our house completed, you might want to add a personalized
detail to it, like a special furniture, wall paint, or make it a smart home.

Thinking about this, we can add functionality to our token, in any non-standard
fashion. We are not going to cover any modifications to our code here, but we
strongly encourage you to be bold, creative and experiment with different
aspects for the token.

A few examples could be:

- A token that accrues or drips more tokens, depending on how long have you been
  hodling (tip: you can override functions like `balanceOf` and
  `_beforeTokenTransfer` / `_afterTokenTransfer` from the inherited ERC20)
- A token that can only be transferred or received if you hold another specific
token (i.e. an NFT from a specific collection)
- A token that looses the balance if you don't transact or transfer it regularly

The possibilities are endless and we want you to go wild with your imagination.

## House Inspection

Before we go to the Real Estate Register, we need to make sure everything is
working according to your local rules, so let's call an inspector to see if we
got everything right.

In our analogy, the inspector will be the Solidity compiler. Later on, when we
have more dexterity in this new realm we'll be adding tests to make sure
everything is spot on, but that's for another lesson.

Since we layed out our project using Foundry, we only need to step into our
project's folder and run one command:

```bash
forge build
```

Here's what I got in the console:

```bash
[⠒] Compiling...
[⠃] Compiling 11 files with 0.8.19
[⠒] Solc 0.8.19 finished in 1.29s
Compiler run successful
```

Everything compiled successfully and is ready to deploy.

If you have any problems here, the compiler might have found some typos or
errors in your code, pay attention to the messages in the console and see if you
can find and fix them. If you can't fix them, you can go into our forum and try
to ask our community for help by explaining your error, the console output and
your configuration (OS, version, foundry and solidity version, etc.)

## Inscribe your house in the Real Estate Register

Or... Let's deploy our contract!

Now that we have our house built, we need to register it so as to guarantee the
property rights. We can think of this as deploying our contract to a blockchain,
where our token will be fully functioning for every address that wants to
interact with it.

We are going to need a small amount of Sepolia ETH to be able to pay for the
transaction to deploy our contract. If you already have some Test ETH in Sepolia,
you can continue, if you don't you can always ask for some in the many faucets
that are online. Some options are: [Alchemy](https://sepoliafaucet.com/),
[Sepolia Faucet](https://testnet-faucet.com/sepolia/) or
[Quicknode](https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia), but you can find more if you search
for Sepolia Faucet in any search engine.

We are going to create an `.env` file, where we will store our _secrets_. And
when we mean _secrets_, we are specially referring to the private key to your
wallet. Never, ever share this with anyone, not even us. Anyone who gets hold of
your keys, can drain your wallet.

This is why we strongly advice to use a separate wallet for our development,
that should not hold anything with real value in it. It's not the first time,
even for experienced developers, that we accidentally upload our `.env` file to
GitHub, and once it's on the internet we can consider it to be public.

So, with that important notice out of the way, we create a new file in our
project's root folder called `.env` and we should fill it with this:

```env
RAW_PRIVATE_KEY=REPLACE_THIS_VALUE_WITH_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
ETH_RPC_URL=https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia
CHAIN=sepolia
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=REPLACE_WITH_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
```

Remember to replace the `REPLACE_THIS_VALUE_WITH_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with your
development wallet's private.
In the spirit of Open Source Software (OSS) we recommend you to also replace the
`REPLACE_WITH_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` with your etherscan API KEY so we can verify
our contract.

Overview of our values:

- **RAW_PRIVATE_KEY**: Here we shall paste our development wallet's private key
  after the `=` sign
- **ETH_RPC_URL**: This is the token from our RPC provider, we are using a public
  one but you can use your Infura, Alchemy, Quicknode or whatever provider you
  prefer
- **CHAIN**: The blockchain where we will be deploying out contract. We are using
  the Sepolia testnet since this is not intended to be on mainnet.
- **ETHERSCAN_API_KEY**: Here we will use our Etherscan API KEY so we can verify
  our contract for everyone to see the deployed code and foster transparency in
  the web3 space.

Once we have this values inside the file, we can source it to have this values
as enviroment variables before using foundry's deploy tools.

There are many ways to load these values into environment variables, depending
on which shell you use (Bash, zsh, fish...). The next command works with most of
bash-compatible shells:

```bash
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
```

If you are using Fish or other shell, you can search on how to create a function
that does the same (Tip: [envsource fish function](https://gist.github.com/nikoheikkila/dd4357a178c8679411566ba2ca280fcc)).

Once we have those values in our environment, our Foundry tool to deploy will
know what wallet to deploy from, what node or RPC in the blockchain to connect
to and what chain do we want to deploy to.

<Callout emoji='💡' size='md' variant='info'>

Remember that if you close your terminal session, all these variables with your
private keys gets wiped from memory, so you need to run this command again if
you want to continue the lesson at a later date.

</Callout>

We also need to pass our constructor 1 argument, our token's initial allocation.
All the foundry tools expect values to be passed in `wei`, so we are going to
use `cast` to find out how many `wei` are, for example, 1000 `ETH` (or `MTK` in
our case):

```bash
cast --to-wei 1000
```

My output:

```less
1000000000000000000000
```

Now we can use this value when we need to deploy. To deploy our contract we will
use the `forge create` tool.

<Callout emoji='⚠️' size='md' variant='info'>

We **don't** have to copy our private key in the command! That's one of the
reasons to use the `.env` file: we know exactly where our private key is and
we are responsible to not publish this file anywhere. We can even delete it
after we deploy the contract.
If you write your private key in a command on the terminal, all the things you
type in the terminal get stored in the terminal's history, which could be in a
publicly accesible file in your computer. That's why we are using an `.env` file.

</Callout>

Notice aside, this is the command we can use to finally deploy our contract:

```bash
forge create src/MyToken.sol:MyToken \
    --constructor-args 1000000000000000000000 \
    --verify \
    --private-key $RAW_PRIVATE_KEY
```

<Callout emoji='💡' size='md' variant='info'>

Remember that if you used a different name for your token and your `.sol`
file, you'll need to adjust this command.

</Callout>


Do you see how we used the value that `cast` gave us as a parameter after the
`--constructor-args` modifier? We are passing down arguments to our solidity
constructor right from our command-line! How cool is that?

We also used `--verify` to let the tool know we want to verify our contract in
Etherscan. If you didn't fill your Etherscan API KEY, don't use this modifier or
the tool will return an error when trying to verify.

This is the output I got:

```less

```

If we filter out all information, we can pay attention to the second line, where
the tool tells us what is the address of the deployed contract:
`0xCE68eD7AEd9A1c6C185f2B8b576e7cBD7bf5dAAf`.

You can go into [Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/) block explorer
and search for this address that the command returned to check out your very own
newly deployed smart contract!

![ERC20.etherscan](/assets/lessons/6/ERC20.etherscan.png)

If you got to verify it, it also gives you a link to see your contract on the
block explorer, in our case it's the last line the _Submitted contract for
verification_ section: [Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xce68ed7aed9a1c6c185f2b8b576e7cbd7bf5daaf) **and** you get to see the code for
the contract and all it's libraries right there in the tab named _Contract_ with
a green checkmark.

If you scroll down, you'll see our code. It was the last file of the set for me:

Etherscan also gives you a frontend to easily interact with the contract. Inside
our contract tab, you get 3 tabs: Code, Read Contract and Write Contract.

We can go and check for our balance by clicking in Read Contract tab and then
searching for the `balanceOf` function:

![ERC20.balanceOf](/assets/lessons/6/ERC20.balanceOf.png)

Copy and paste your wallet's address (the one you used to deploy the contract)
and click Query. You should have as many wei as you passed to the constructor
when deploying. In my case it was 1000000000000000000000 wei and since we left
our decimals in 18, that would be exactly 1000 MTK.

## Invite your frens!

That's it! We deployed our contract on the Sepolia testnet, and our token should
be live and kicking.

Now that we have built our house and it's has been accepted in the real estate
register, we can invite our friends by transferring them some MTK, or **even**
minting them some tokens, even if that affects your tokenomics 😉
